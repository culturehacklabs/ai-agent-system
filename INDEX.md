## Shared Files

These files are shared across all agents. They are never loaded by default — only when a specific need arises. (They carry their canonical, unversioned names; the older `_v#` files and the duplicate Agent Directory were retired in the June 2026 cleanup, and `KB_AI_Fluency_v3.md` was renamed to `KB_AI_Fluency.md` in v2.0.0.)

| File | Purpose | Load when |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `KB_CHL_Method.md` | Full method theory, political stance, vocabulary | Questions about methodology, narrative theory, political stance |
| `KB_AI_Fluency.md` | Ethical AI use, the 4Ds framework, responsible research | Questions about AI ethics, data responsibility, research practice |
| `KB_Agent_Directory.md` | System map, handoff chain, I/O contracts | Navigating between agents, confirming handoffs |

---

## Agent 00 · General Q&A

**Phase:** Entry point / navigation
**Primary users:** Anyone — newcomers, practitioners mid-process, facilitators
**Stand-alone use:** Yes — this is the starting point for anyone new to the system

**What it does:** Answers questions about the Culture Hack Method, defines concepts, clarifies which phase does what, and routes practitioners to the right agent. Does not produce phase outputs.

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `00_QA_Instructions.md` | System prompt: identity, KB index, routing table, what the agent does not do |
| `KB_00_QA_Module.md` | Quick reference: phase summaries, common questions, navigation guide, "when stuck" map |
| `KB_00_QA_Documentation.md` | Documentation requirements per phase: required vs. optional fields |
| `KB_00_QA_Prompting.md` | Starter prompts for newcomers and mid-process practitioners |

**Receives:** Any question · **Produces:** Answers, concept explanations, routing to phase agents
*(4 files. No Tools file — this agent calls no external tools.)*

---

## Agent 01 · Ask — Point of View

**Phase:** Ask · **Primary users:** Collectives beginning a new hack or refining a previous one · **Stand-alone:** Yes

**What it does:** Guides development of the collective Point of View (POV): who they are, what narrative problem they observe, what they want to shift, and their theory of change. Produces Extended POV + Short POV. Also supports a Poetic Manifesto mode from assembly transcripts.

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `01_Ask_Instructions.md` | System prompt: three modes (Hacking, Learning, Poetic Manifesto), KB index, 5-step workflow |
| `KB_01_Ask_Module.md` | Ask phase theory, four-part POV format, documentation questions, iteration workflow |
| `KB_01_Ask_Actions.md` | POV templates (Extended + Short), iteration format, Poetic Manifesto section, quality checklist |
| `KB_01_Ask_Prompting.md` | Starter and power prompts, reference POV example |
| `KB_01_Ask_Tools.md` | No external tools; elicitation approach and AI-use principles |

**Receives:** Any — draft, context, transcript, or nothing · **Produces:** Extended POV + Short POV (+ optional Poetic Manifesto) · **Passes to:** Agent 02a (Short POV)
*(5 files.)*

---

## Agent 02a · Listen — Listening Model

**Phase:** Listen · **Primary users:** Practitioners ready to begin research · **Stand-alone:** Yes

**What it does:** Transforms the Short POV into a research question, then builds a Listening Model (five parameters: What/Who/When/Where/How) for Small and Big Listening. Output — the Big Listening Inquiry — is the brief handed to Agent 02b. Includes Small Listening instrument design on request.

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `02a_Listen_Instructions.md` | System prompt: modes (incl. Iteration), KB index, workflow, feasibility check |
| `KB_02a_Listen_Module.md` | Listen phase theory, Listening Model structure, five parameters, documentation questions, iteration |

| `KB_02a_Listen_Prompting.md` | Starter and power prompts for new and iterating practitioners |
| `KB_02a_Listen_Tools.md` | No execution tools at this stage; describes what travels to 02b |
| `KB_02a_Listen_SmallListening.md` | Small Listening instrument design: interview guides, observation frameworks, survey design |

**Receives:** Short POV (or updated POV + Case Study on iteration) · **Produces:** Listening Model + Big Listening Inquiry · **Passes to:** Agent 02b
*(6 files.)*

---

## Agent 02b · Research

**Phase:** Listen · **Primary users:** Practitioners executing or processing research · **Stand-alone:** Partial (Big Listening needs web research tools)

**What it does:** Executes Big Listening and structures Small Listening data. Applies the NO INVENTION principle — every claim traces to a Folio ID in the CSV. Produces the Narrative Report, CSV Database, and ANP Source Library, plus a Handoff Checklist for Agent 03.

**Tools note:** On Claude it uses Exa Search MCP + Research mode; on ChatGPT, Web Search (+ Deep Research where available) and Code Interpreter for the CSV. On platforms without web search, web research is handled separately (Perplexity, SerpAPI, Tavily, etc.) and fed in. The process and CSV structure stay the same.

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `02b_Research_Instructions.md` | System prompt: NO INVENTION, five modes, KB index, 7-step workflow |
| `KB_02b_Research_Module.md` | Research phase theory, key concepts, research process, iteration + Small-Listening-only paths, boundary with 03 |

*(6 files.)*

---

## Agent 03 · Understand — Narrative Communities + Mapper

**Phase:** Understand · **Primary users:** Practitioners analysing research and mapping communities · **Stand-alone:** No (needs 02b outputs)

**What it does:** Applies four tools in sequence — ANP Analysis, Language Analysis, Justice/Ontology Community Mapping (with a Map Check-in co-creation moment), and Window of Discourse — to produce the Community Analysis Report and Narrative Map. Includes a critical note on Ontofake communities (automated analysis is biased toward misreading cooptation; practitioner knowledge is essential).

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `03_Understand_Instructions.md` | System prompt: modes, 6-step analytical sequence, Map Check-in as mandatory step, KB index |
| `KB_03_Understand_Module.md` | Understand phase theory, all key concepts (ANP, frame analysis, Justice/Ontology map with Ontofake note, Acupuncture Points, Window of Discourse), Strategic Insights vs. Narrative Intentions, iteration |

## Version Manifest

*Single source of truth for file versions. A file's footer must match its row here. Before any release, diff footers against this table — a mismatch means a file didn't land. Version = the release in which the file last changed; untouched files keep their earlier version.*

**Release v2.1.0 — 2026-10-14.** Files in the rows below are at **v2.1.0 · 2026-10-14**; every other file remains at **v2.0.0 · 2026-07-05**.

Scope of the v2.1.0 release: ChatGPT Projects setup as its own install option, plus expanded guidance for other LLM services. Agent 02a/02b tool references now name equivalents on other platforms; `02b_Research_Instructions.md` trimmed under the Custom GPT 8,000-character limit by removing text duplicated in its Module KB; every Instructions file clarifies what "Load" means for retrieval-based knowledge; Agent 03 gains a chart fallback where Mermaid doesn't render; ChatGPT setup added to `INSTALL.md` and `docs/`; broken README/INDEX links fixed; install zips are now generated by `scripts/build_install_zips.py` into `install v2.1.0/`, plus ChatGPT Free bundles (KBs merged into ≤5 files) in `install v2.1.0/chatgpt-free/`. Tracked in issue #1.

**Release v2.0.0 — 2026-07-05.**

Scope of the v2.0.0 release: introduced file versioning; renamed `KB_AI_Fluency_v3.md` → `KB_AI_Fluency.md` and re-landed the corrected `KB_00_QA_Module.md`; renumbered Agent 05→05a (Hack) and Agent 06→05b (Impact), folding Evaluate into the Hack phase; added phase words to the 02a/02b/03 stems (`02a_Listen_`, `02b_Research_`, `03_Understand_`); aligned handoff labels across the chain (Community Analysis Report · Recoded Narrative (with Message) · Logistics Plan · Post-Hack Evaluation); "AI Agent Suite" → "AI Agent System"; created Agent 04's Prompting + Tools KBs; and applied the Agent 03 content fixes. Full detail in `CHL_Agent_System_Changelog.md` (Session 4).
