# Agent 02a · Listen (design)

*Companion to the "02 — Listen" video. What the Listening-Model agent is, how to work with it, and what goes in and comes out.*

New to the system? Watch the "00 — Introduction" video first. This guide assumes the agents are already installed. Note that **Listen is two agents**: **02a designs the research, 02b runs it.** Each is its own Project. This page covers 02a; see the Agent 02b page for the research agent.

## ✅ Before you start — install checklist (Agent 02a · Listening Model)

*Uses the same three file types as every agent; only the Agent KBs differ. The three Shared KBs are identical across all agents.*

**Instructions field:**

- [ ] `02a_Listen_Instructions.md`

**Agent KBs (upload):**

- [ ] `KB_02a_Listen_Module.md`
- [ ] `KB_02a_Listen_Actions.md`
- [ ] `KB_02a_Listen_Prompting.md`
- [ ] `KB_02a_Listen_Tools.md`
- [ ] `KB_02a_Listen_SmallListening.md`

**Shared KBs (upload — same in every agent):**

- [ ] `KB_CHL_Method.md`
- [ ] `KB_AI_Fluency.md`
- [ ] `KB_Agent_Directory.md`

## ⬇️ Install it the quick way — the agent zip

Everything in the checklist above also ships as a single **zip** in the repo's [`install v2.0.0`](https://github.com/culturehacklabs/ai-agent-system/tree/main/install%20v2.0.0) folder. Each zip contains two folders that map straight onto the three buckets:

- **`Project Instructions (paste)`** → **bucket 1**. A single text file — open it in any text editor and paste it into the Project's **Instructions** field. *(It's the contents of `02a_Listen_Instructions.md`, saved as `.txt` so it opens on any computer without a Markdown viewer.)*
- **`Project Documents (upload)`** → **buckets 2 + 3**. All of Agent 02a's KBs *and* the three Shared KBs. Upload every file as Project knowledge.

**Five steps:** (1) download Agent 02a's zip; (2) create a new Claude Project named *"CHL Agent 02a — Listen"*; (3) paste the Instructions text into the **Instructions** field; (4) upload everything in `Project Documents (upload)`; (5) start with a prompt from `KB_02a_Listen_Prompting.md`.

Prefer to pull the files individually from the repo instead? The checklist above lists every one by name — see the [Install guide](../install.md) for the file-by-file route. The zip is just the fast path; it doesn't replace the repo.

## 1. What it is

The Listen phase produces the **baseline** the whole cycle builds on: a structural picture of the narratives and communities in your space. It's split into two agents so that designing the research and executing it stay clean and separate.

**Agent 02a · Listening Model** turns your Short POV into a focused **research framework** — the Listening Model — and a **Big Listening Inquiry** to hand to 02b. It designs research; it does not run it.

Two ideas to hold onto across the whole Listen phase:

- **Big vs Small Listening.** Big Listening is what AI can scan across the open web; Small Listening is community interviews, observation, and relationship-based research your team does. Big gives the structural map; Small fills what the map can't reach. You need both.
- **Interpretation comes later.** The Listen phase surfaces *what is there*. Analysis, mapping, and meaning-making belong to Agent 03.

## 2. General instructions

**Modes:** Hacking ⚡ (default), Learning 🌱 (write "learning mode"), and **Iteration 🔄** (activated when you paste prior-cycle output — a Case Study, Post-Hack Evaluation, or Narrative Strategy — so it *updates* the model rather than rebuilding it).

**How a session flows:** receive the Short POV → confirm it's specific enough → build a focused **Research Question** → build the **Listening Model** across five parameters — **What** (themes/keywords), **Who** (actors/communities), **When** (timeframe), **Where** (platforms/geography), **How** (methods + documentation) → run a quick **feasibility check** against your team's real capacity → produce the **Big Listening Inquiry** for 02b. It can also help design **Small Listening** instruments (interview guides, observation frameworks) via `KB_02a_Listen_SmallListening.md`.

*Starter prompt:* "Here is my Short POV: [paste]. Help me design a Listening Model and Big Listening Inquiry."

## 3. Input → Output

- **Receives from 01:** Short POV. *(Iteration inputs: Case Study · Post-Hack Evaluation · Narrative Strategy from a prior cycle.)*
- **Produces:** the Listening Model + the **Big Listening Inquiry** (Research Question + five parameters).
- **Passes to 02b:** the Big Listening Inquiry.

**The handoff in one line:** 01 → Short POV → **02a → Big Listening Inquiry → 02b**.
