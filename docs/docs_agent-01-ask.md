# Agent 01 · Ask

*Companion to the "01 — Ask" video. What the Ask agent is, how to work with it, and what goes in and comes out.*

New to the system? Watch the "00 — Introduction" video first, and use Agent 00 for any method question. This guide assumes the agents are already installed.

## ✅ Before you start — install checklist (Agent 01)

*Each agent is built from the same three file types (see the Install guide). Confirm all of these are in your Agent 01 Project before you begin. Only the Agent KBs differ from other agents — the three Shared KBs are the same everywhere.*

**Instructions field:**

- [ ] `01_Ask_Instructions.md`

**Agent KBs (upload):**

- [ ] `KB_01_Ask_Module.md`
- [ ] `KB_01_Ask_Actions.md`
- [ ] `KB_01_Ask_Prompting.md`
- [ ] `KB_01_Ask_Tools.md`

**Shared KBs (upload — same in every agent):**

- [ ] `KB_CHL_Method.md`
- [ ] `KB_AI_Fluency.md`
- [ ] `KB_Agent_Directory.md`

## ⬇️ Install it the quick way — the agent zip

Everything in the checklist above also ships as a single **zip** in the repo's [`install v2.0.0`](https://github.com/culturehacklabs/ai-agent-system/tree/main/install%20v2.0.0) folder. Each zip contains two folders that map straight onto the three buckets:

- **`Project Instructions (paste)`** → **bucket 1**. A single text file — open it in any text editor and paste it into the Project's **Instructions** field. *(It's the contents of `01_Ask_Instructions.md`, saved as `.txt` so it opens on any computer without a Markdown viewer.)*
- **`Project Documents (upload)`** → **buckets 2 + 3**. All of Agent 01's KBs *and* the three Shared KBs. Upload every file as Project knowledge.

**Five steps:** (1) download Agent 01's zip; (2) create a new Claude Project named *"CHL Agent 01 — Ask"*; (3) paste the Instructions text into the **Instructions** field; (4) upload everything in `Project Documents (upload)`; (5) start with a prompt from `KB_01_Ask_Prompting.md`.

Prefer to pull the files individually from the repo instead? The checklist above lists every one by name — see the [Install guide](../install.md) for the file-by-file route. The zip is just the fast path; it doesn't replace the repo.

## 1. What it is

**Agent 01 · Ask** is the first working agent in the cycle. Its job is to help your collective develop a clear, sharp **Point of View (POV)** — the statement that anchors the entire culture hack. For many Fellows it's the true entry point into the method.

A good POV answers four things about your collective:

- **Identity** — who you are, and why *you* are the ones doing this hack.
- **Narrative Observation** — the *narrative problem* you see (a frame or cultural story), not just a material condition.
- **Vision** — the shift you want in the story.
- **Theory of Change** — why changing the narrative matters for the transformation you seek.

The single most important habit the agent enforces: **name a narrative problem, not a material condition.** "Rents are too high" is a condition; "the story that housing is a private asset rather than a shared right" is a narrative. The agent will gently push you from the first toward the second.

## 2. General instructions

**Three modes:**

- **Hacking Mode ⚡ (default)** — works through all four POV questions in one flow and produces the POV, asking only for what's missing.
- **Learning Mode 🌱** — takes one block at a time and explains each concept before asking. Turn it on by writing **"learning mode"**. Best when the method is new to you.
- **Poetic Manifesto Mode 🎙️** — weaves a poem-like collective text from your participants' *own words* (from an assembly transcript or workshop notes). It transcribes and arranges rather than interprets. Trigger it by saying "poetic manifesto" or by arriving with a transcript.

**How a session flows (default path):**

1. **Open** — the agent checks whether you're starting fresh, refining a draft, or iterating from a previous cycle, and whether you're inside the Rhizome Fellowship (where the Five Pathways apply).
2. **Gather** — it works through the four blocks: Identity, Narrative Observation, Vision, Theory of Change.
3. **Produce** — it drafts your **Extended POV** (a full paragraph) and **Short POV** (1–3 sentences); optionally a Pathway and a Timeline.
4. **Pressure-test** — it checks that your Short POV is specific enough to orient a research question and names a narrative problem.
5. **Hand off** — it confirms you're ready to move to Agent 02a.

**Prompting advice — write in the first-person plural ("We are…") and give real context.** Starter prompts:

- *Fresh start* — "I want to develop a POV for a culture hack. We're [collective] working on [area]. I don't have a draft yet."
- *Refining* — "Here's a draft POV — can you help me sharpen it? [paste]"
- *From notes* — "Here are notes from our team workshop. Help us turn this into a proper POV. [paste]"
- *Fellowship, new Fellow* — "I'm a Rhizome Fellow. Guide me through my POV and connect it to one of the Five Pathways. Learning mode please."

If you get stuck, the agent's prompt library (`KB_01_Ask_Prompting.md`) has "power prompts" for the common traps — a generic identity, a programme theory mistaken for a narrative theory, a POV too broad to research.

## 3. Input → Output

**Input (any of):** answers to the four POV questions · a draft POV · a transcript or assembly notes · a general area of concern.

**Output:**

- **Technical:** Extended POV + Short POV (required); Pathway + Timeline (optional).
- **Poetic:** a Poetic Manifesto, with an optional translation into a Technical POV.

**Handoff:** the **Short POV → Agent 02a (Listening Model)**. That short, sharp statement is what the Listen phase turns into a research plan — so it's worth getting right before you move on.

**On iteration:** returning for a later cycle? The agent helps you *refine* the POV based on what the last hack taught you — it doesn't rebuild it from scratch.
