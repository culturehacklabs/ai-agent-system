# Agent 02b · Research (do)

*Companion to the "02 — Listen" video. What the Research agent is, how to work with it, and what goes in and comes out.*

**Listen is two agents**: **02a designs the research, 02b runs it.** This page covers 02b; see the Agent 02a page for the design agent. Each is its own Project — and 02b needs the **Exa Search** connector enabled.

## ✅ Before you start — install checklist (Agent 02b · Research)

*Uses the same three file types as every agent; only the Agent KBs differ. The three Shared KBs are identical across all agents.*

**Instructions field:**

- [ ] `02b_Research_Instructions.md`

**Agent KBs (upload):**

- [ ] `KB_02b_Research_Module.md`
- [ ] `KB_02b_Research_Actions.md`
- [ ] `KB_02b_Research_Prompting.md`
- [ ] `KB_02b_Research_Tools.md`
- [ ] `KB_02b_Research_MultiInquiry.md`

**Shared KBs (upload — same in every agent):**

- [ ] `KB_CHL_Method.md`
- [ ] `KB_AI_Fluency.md`
- [ ] `KB_Agent_Directory.md`

⚠ **Also:** [ ] enable the **Exa Search** connector for this Project.

## ⬇️ Install it the quick way — the agent zip

Everything in the checklist above also ships as a single **zip** in the repo's [`install v2.0.0`](https://github.com/culturehacklabs/ai-agent-system/tree/main/install%20v2.0.0) folder. Each zip contains two folders that map straight onto the three buckets:

- **`Project Instructions (paste)`** → **bucket 1**. A single text file — open it in any text editor and paste it into the Project's **Instructions** field. *(It's the contents of `02b_Research_Instructions.md`, saved as `.txt` so it opens on any computer without a Markdown viewer.)*
- **`Project Documents (upload)`** → **buckets 2 + 3**. All of Agent 02b's KBs *and* the three Shared KBs. Upload every file as Project knowledge.

**Five steps:** (1) download Agent 02b's zip; (2) create a new Claude Project named *"CHL Agent 02b — Research"*; (3) paste the Instructions text into the **Instructions** field; (4) upload everything in `Project Documents (upload)`; (5) start with a prompt from `KB_02b_Research_Prompting.md`.

⚠ **One thing the zip can't do:** enabling the **Exa Search** connector. The zip carries the files; you still turn on Exa for this Project yourself (see the checklist above).

Prefer to pull the files individually from the repo instead? The checklist above lists every one by name — see the [Install guide](../install.md) for the file-by-file route. The zip is just the fast path; it doesn't replace the repo.

## 1. What it is

**Agent 02b · Research** takes the Big Listening Inquiry from 02a and **executes the Big Listening**: large-scale digital research, plus processing any Small Listening data your team gathers. Its outputs are evidence-based and structural — it surfaces *what is there*, with a source for every claim. Interpretation is Agent 03's job.

Two ideas to hold onto:

- **Big vs Small Listening.** Big Listening is what AI can scan across the open web; Small Listening is community interviews, observation, and relationship-based research your team does. Big gives the structural map; Small fills what the map can't reach. You need both.
- **02b's non-negotiable rule: it does not invent anything.** Every statement it makes traces to a source in its CSV. If it can't source something, it flags it as an *unverified pattern* for Small Listening to confirm — it never states it as a finding. This matters because the Narrative Report becomes the baseline the whole cycle is measured against.

---

## 2. General instructions

**Tools:** it uses the **Exa Search** connector (deep web search) and Claude **Research mode** to synthesise. **Enable Exa in your account before running 02b.** In other chatbots without Exa, run the search with a separate tool (Perplexity, Tavily, or manually) and paste results in — the process stays the same.

**Modes:** Hacking ⚡, Learning 🌱, **Iteration 🔄** (extend the existing CSV, don't replace it), **Multi-Inquiry 🔀** (run several inquiries into one combined report), and **Small-Listening-only 🎙️** (process community material directly when no Big Listening Inquiry exists).

**How a session flows:** confirm the Inquiry is specific enough → execute Big Listening, assigning a **Folio ID** to every source in the CSV as it goes → fold in any Small Listening data, flagging where it confirms or contradicts the digital picture → draft **3–5 narrative communities** (observations only, no interpretation) → flag the strongest sources per community into the **ANP Source Library** → produce the three outputs → end with a **Handoff Checklist** of 4–6 open questions for Agent 03.

*Starter prompt:* "Here's my Big Listening Inquiry from 02a: [paste]. Run the Big Listening and produce the outputs."

**Fluency reminder for this phase:** search results reflect what's indexed and ranked — marginalised communities and non-English content are under-represented. Name those gaps in the report rather than treating the data as complete, and apply the community test to every community description.

## 3. Input → Output

- **Receives from 02a:** the Big Listening Inquiry. *(Also: Small Listening material; a previous CSV + report for iteration; multiple inquiries for Multi-Inquiry mode.)*
- **Produces:** **(A) Narrative Report · (B) CSV Database · (C) ANP Source Library.**
- **Passes to 03:** all three, plus the Handoff Checklist.

**The handoff in one line:** 01 → Short POV → 02a → Big Listening Inquiry → **02b → Narrative Report + CSV Database + ANP Source Library → 03**.
