## System Map

The Culture Hack Method is a **cycle**, not a linear sequence. Phases can be revisited and updated rather than restarted from scratch on subsequent iterations.

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
        ↓                                         ↑
Ask → Listen → Understand → Recode → Hack + Evaluate
 01   02a→02b      03          04       05 + 06
```

Entry point for any question: **00 Q&A Agent**

## Handoff Chain

| From | Passes to | What is handed off |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 01 | 02a | Short POV |
| 02a | 02b | Big Listening Inquiry (research question + parameters) |
| 02b | 03 | Narrative Report + CSV Database + ANP Source Library |
| 03 | 04 | Community Analysis Report + Narrative Map (incl. Narrative Intentions + Window of Discourse) |
| 04 | 05 | Narrative Strategy + Recoded Narrative |
| 05 | 06 | Hacking Tree + Project Logistics |
| 06 | 02a or 04 | Case Study + updated POV (cycle continues) |

**Note on the 03 → 04 boundary:** Agent 03 produces *Narrative Intentions* — options for what the strategy could pursue. Agent 04 turns these into *Narrative Objectives* — the committed strategic decisions. Analysis is not strategy; the decision belongs to 04.

**On iteration:** In a second or later cycle, the narrative practitioner does not restart at 01. They update the existing Listening Model (02a) with new parameters, run new research (02b), and update community profiles (03). The POV may also be refined based on what was learned, but it is not rebuilt from scratch.

## Modes (All Agents)

**Hacking Mode ⚡ (default)** — executes directly, asks only for what is missing.
**Learning Mode 🌱 (on request)** — step-by-step, explanatory, teaches as it goes.

All agents ask for missing context before proceeding regardless of mode. Some agents add specialized modes (e.g. 01 Poetic Manifesto; 02a/02b/03 Iteration; 02b Multi-Inquiry and Small-Listening-only; 04/05 Stand-alone) — these are documented in each agent's own Instructions file.

## 00 Q&A Agent — Module KB Index

The Q&A agent is the only agent that references all module KBs. These are loaded on demand based on the topic of the question.

## Platform Setup Notes

**Claude Project:** Each agent = one Project. Instructions file = System Prompt. KB files = Project Knowledge.

**Other LLMs:** Paste Instructions as system prompt. Paste relevant KBs into context on demand.

**Orchestration (future):** Each agent is a callable sub-agent. The handoff table above defines the I/O contract. The 00 Q&A Agent functions as the routing layer.
